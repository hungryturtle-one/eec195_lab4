# eec195_lab4

 In this lab the task was to create a buffer that could store 128 bits of data from the ADC pin. Using the values of the buffer, dthe peak to peak voltage, minimum, maximum, period, and frequency were all calculated. In addition, the task was to create a ping and pong buffer that would switch when one buffer is full. A linescan camera was simulated by generating two GPIO output signals (SI and CLK).
